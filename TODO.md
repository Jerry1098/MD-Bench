* Evaluate LJ mixing rules on GPUs and other cases
* Evaluate CP for AMD GPUs
* Use a single capacity for the neighbor-lists and evaluate CPU vs GPU performance
* Evaluate Lennard-Jones (and Coloumb) force components to be integrated into short-range kernels
* Double cut-off method with pruning (inner, outer)
* Implement compression of atoms that need to be computed, only execute arithmetic when register is full
